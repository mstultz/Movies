This is an example iOS application demonstrating functional reactive view models using an application architecture I learned from [Stephen Celis](https://www.stephencelis.com) and [Brandon Williams](https://www.fewbutripe.com). We used a form of this architecture extensively on the [HQ Trivia](http://www.hqtrivia.com) iOS app. It fetches movie data from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies via `pod install`
- Get an API key from https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/
- Paste your key into `apiKey` in `Environment.swift`
